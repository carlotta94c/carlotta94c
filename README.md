### Hi there 👋

#### About me
My name is Carlotta Castelluccio (SHE/HER):
- 💻I am passionate about AI and ML and I am a long-life learner.
- 🎨I love art in all its forms, but probably music and cinema are my favourites.
- 🐟Water is my element: I love swimming, preferably in the sea - probably because I was born in a warm summer in a small town on the seaside in the South of Italy.
- ✈️Fun Fact: I can speak 3 languages and in the last 10 years I changed 5 flats, 4 cities and 2 countries because of my study/my job.
